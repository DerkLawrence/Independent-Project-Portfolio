  <h2>My Introduction to the World of Coding</h2>
  
  <div class="column"><p>My name is Derek Lawrence and I've recently begun coding in an effort to expand my horizons and explore new career opportunities. My career paths up to this point have been led primarily by my pursuit to work within, or adjacent to, the music industry. With the newfound skills I aquire thru epicodus and my own exploration of the field I hope to reintigrate my talents into that same industry. This is where my passion lies and I look forward to opportunities afforded me by this new skillset.</p></div>
