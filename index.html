  <h2>My Introduction to the World of Coding</h2>
  
  <div class="column"><p>My name is <strong>Derek Lawrence</strong> and I've recently begun coding in an effort to expand my horizons and explore new career opportunities. My career paths up to this point have been led primarily by my pursuit to work within, or adjacent to, the music industry. With the newfound skills I aquire thru epicodus and my own exploration of the field I hope to reintigrate my talents into that same industry. This is where my passion lies and I look forward to opportunities afforded me by this new skillset.</p></div>

  <h3>A few things about me</h3>
    <p>My interests have always been linked to getting to know the innerworkings of things. I like to know the hows and whys of functionality. Coding seemed like a natural interest to pursue since it's something my daily life is inextricably tied to. My interest in technological make-ups began early as I would, to the frustration of my family, take apart any belongings that caught my interest. This lent itself later on to an interest in music and performance. I started working at an early age to fund my new and expensive hobbies and the beginning of my working career altered very little thrughout my life. I found working for restaurants, record stores, and music distributors such as <a href="https://cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a> served to fund and support my ambitions. It is now, in an era defined by a pandemic that I look elsewhere for a new path to expand my interests and forge new paths for the future.</p>
